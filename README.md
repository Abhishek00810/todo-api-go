Go Todo API: A Production-Grade RESTful ServiceThis repository contains the source code for a high-performance, containerized REST API for a Todo application. This project is a demonstration of modern backend development practices, including a multi-service architecture, secure authentication, a full test suite, and cloud deployment.üöÄ Live DemoThe API is deployed and live on Render. You can interact with it using curl or Postman.Live URL: https://todo-api-n1s3.onrender.com/Note: The service is on a free tier and may "sleep" during periods of inactivity. The first request might take 15-30 seconds to respond as the container starts up (this is known as a "cold start").üèõÔ∏è ArchitectureThis project runs as a multi-container application orchestrated locally by Docker Compose and deployed as a multi-service blueprint on Render. It follows a clean separation of concerns between the API, data, and caching layers.graph TD

cd your-repo-name
Create your environment file:Copy the example file and fill in your desired local database credentials.cp .env.example .env
Run the application stack:This single command will build the Go binary, start the Postgres and Redis containers, and run your API.docker-compose up --build
The API will be available at http://localhost:8080.üß™ Running TestsThe project includes a full integration test suite that runs against a separate, temporary test database.Start the test environment:docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d
Run the tests:make test
Tear down the test environment:docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml down
